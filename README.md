# concatenation-and-sums
Trying to find 2 integers that when added results in the same as if added as strings.
So far I'd tried every positive integer up to 1000 and have found no pairs.
With further optimization I'll try a bigger range.

THIS IS AN OPEN CHALLENGE: if anybody has access to a faster computer or can tweak this to run in parallel in a supercluster then do it and post the found pairs as pull requests. I'll add them here
